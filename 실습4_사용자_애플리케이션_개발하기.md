# 사용자 애플리케이션 개발하기:

### <a name="runlocal"></a>Marbles 구동하기(Run)
Marbles 애플리케이션은 node.js 로 개발되어 있습니다.  
먼저 Marbles 의 dependencies 들을 설치해 보겠습니다.

1. 개발 서버 putty 커맨드 창을 연 후 Marbles 디렉토리로 이동하십시오.
2. 커맨드 창에서 다음을 입력하십시오.type:

		> npm install gulp -g
		> npm install

3. 다음으로, 애플리케이션을 구동하겠습니다. 우리는 IBM Cloud 블록체인 네트워크와 연동하기 때문에 다음 명령어를 수행합니다.

		> gulp marbles_tls

    
4. 만약 잘 수행되었다면 아래와 같은 메시지가 보여야 합니다.

    ![](/doc_images/localhost1.png)
    (콘솔 창에 "NOT launched successfully yet" 라고 출력되어도 괜찮습니다 오키도키).
    
    
    (it is OK if the console output says "NOT launched successfully yet"). 
    If you tried to used gulp marbles_local, but got errors such as "Failed to load user "admin" from local key value store. Error: Error: Private key missing from key store. Can not establish the signing identity for user admin" even though the "client" section of the local connection profile JSON file contains the correct path reference in "client.credentialStore.path", then you might be subject to a bug described in https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-2593. In such a case, backup the contents of the (hidden) directory $HOME/.hfc-key-store and copy all the files from the directory /$HOME/fabric-samples/fabcar/hfc-key-store to $HOME/.hfc-key-store (do not delete $HOME/.hfc-key-store and do not copy the /$HOME/fabric-samples/fabcar/hfc-key-store itself into /$HOME ). After copying the files, re-run gulp marbles_local
    
1. Go to your browser at the url specified in the console and login. You do not need to enter a password or change the prefilled username of `admin`.
    
    ![](/doc_images/localhost2.png)
        
1. Next the set up panel should pop up. Ideally it will walk itself through the 3 stages of initial setup.
    	1. Enroll Admin - this step is communicating with your network's CA to verify the admin user credentials (enrollID/enrollSecret)
    		- If it fails double check the enrollID and enrollSecret fields in your blockchain connection profile
    	1. Finding Chaincode - this step is looking for the marbles chaincode on your peer. It is using the chaincode ID found in your blockchain connection profile. If this is a brand new network it will not exist yet.
    		- If the chaincode was instantiated but it was unable to find it try the "Retry" button.
    	1. Register Marble Owners - this step will create the marble owners you specified in the marbles configuration JSON file
    		- This can take awhile 1-2minutes. Check your console logs for progress.

1. Once you see this message you are good to go:
    
    ![](/doc_images/localhost4.png)
    
1. Marbles is all setup! Now [continue the tutorial](../README.md#use).
